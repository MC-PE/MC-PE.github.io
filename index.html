      The MC-PE.ga website has been made first by the <a href="http://boxofdevs.com">BoxOfDevs team</a>. It became independant from the BoxOfDevs team in August 2016.<br> MC-PE gives out free online/local tools mostly releated to <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>. We first, transfered most of the work by the BoxOfDevs team to still allow them to bd used free, and then started to make new tools. Almost all the releated plugins to mc-pe.ga are now working. We now allow to use online most of the plugins. Enjoy !

Hello everybody! Welcome to the website for MC-PE.ga! This website has recently been redesigned,
as the previous website did not meet our quality standards. 
<br> Here at MC-PE.ga, we set high goals, in order to satisfy our users completely.
In addition, everything that this organization creates is absolutely free! 
<br> That means that you can use any of our plugins or tools, FREE OF CHARGE!
<br> Our plugins are fully compatible with PocketMine, ImagicalMine, ClearSky, and SteadFast2.
Unfortunately, some of our plugins may not be compatible with Genisys. 
<br> We are counting on YOU to test our plugins, and give us feedback on whether they work with Genisys or not.
<br> We hope you find everything that we make very useful!
